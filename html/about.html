                        I began my career in 2011 as a Java developer, the same year I started my Computer Science degree, which I completed in 2014. In 2013, 
                        I transitioned to mobile development.I  later moved to Ireland, where I worked internationally for nearly three years, before coming back 
                        to Brazil at the end of 2018.
                        
                        <br><br> Throughout my career, I have contributed to mobile projects across diverse industries. In recent years, 
                        I was responsible for the Android application of the largest bank in Latin America, overseeing its development and continuous improvement. 
                        
                        <br><br> In 2025, I embarked on a specialization in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, focusing on a career transition and the practical 
                        application of these technologies. That same year, my responsibilities changed and I started working with Generative AI, building and delivering 
                        real-world projects.
